These are the first games I made over 10 years ago when I was first learning to program as a teenager. 

The source code for most of these is long gone, but all except one was programmed in C++.

Blockade: My first game: a Tetris clone. 

Space Duels: My first attempt at an action game, but it's pretty awful. 

Squish: A fast-paced puzzle game with 100 randomized levels. 

Squish 2: The sequel provides a variety of custom levels; level editor included. 

Space Duels 2: My first successful action game in DirectX including a wide array of enemies and powerups. 

Rise of Chaos: The biggest game I completed at the time, it was written in Game Maker 5.0 and has 8 levels filled with hordes of enemies and a variety of custom bosses.
